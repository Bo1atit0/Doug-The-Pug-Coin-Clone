## Project Overview
I aim to imitate the landing page and basic functionality of the original Doug The Pug Coin website. This includes:
- Replicating the layout and design.
- Implementing responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- Adding interactive elements using React.

## Technologies Used
- **React** for building the user interface.
- **JSX** for writing components (a syntax similar to HTML but used in React).
- **CSS3** for styling, including Flexbox.
- **Git** for version control.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/W-A-G-M-I/doug2.git

   ```
3. Install dependencies:

4. Start the development server:
